 * This class implements the Weighted Modified Operation Due Date rule, which
 * extends MOD by taking different job weights into account. The implementation
 * here is based on the analogous extension of the MDD rule by Kanet and Li
 * (2004), which turned out to be more effective than an earlier formulation of
 * the WMOD rule by Jensen et al. (1995).
