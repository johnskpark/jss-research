/**
 * Helper class to use a rule which is designed to assign a low priority to
 * future jobs when the lookahead is enabled, thereby generating non delay
 * schedules. Such a non delay rule has to be set the tie breaker rule of this
 * class.
 * <p>
 * IgnoreFuturedRule assigns each future job a priority of -1 and each "normal"
 * job a priority of +1, therefore the tie breaker rule is used to select one of
 * the non-future jobs.
