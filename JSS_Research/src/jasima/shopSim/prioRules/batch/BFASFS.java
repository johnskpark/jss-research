/**
 * This class implements a batch version of the FASFS rule. Its main purpose is
 * to be used as a tie-breaker for priority rules that operate on batches, e.g.
 * BATCS.
 * <p />
 * BFASFS is supposed to be applied together with BestOfFamilyBatching to choose
 * among batches of different families.
