 * The class implements the Extended Least Work content In Next Queue rule, see
 * Haupt (1989). The work content of all jobs waiting or arriving soon at the
 * work centre which a job visits for its next operation defines the priority of
 * a job. For its last operation, the work content in the next queue of a job is
 * zero.
 * <p>
 * The lookahead needs to be enabled in the simulation for this rule to work
 * properly.
