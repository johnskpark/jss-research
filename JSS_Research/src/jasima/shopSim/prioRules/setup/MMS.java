/**
 * This class implements the Minimum Marginal Setup time rule, developed by Arzi
 * and Raviv (1998), which assigns highest priority to all jobs that belong to
 * the family with the shortest setup time per job, see also Pickardt and Branke
 * (2012).
 * <p>
 * This rule should be used with another rule to distinguish jobs of the
 * selected family.
