/**
 * This class can be used to model scheduled maintenance. Maintenance intervals
 * and duration are modeled using the {@code timeBetweenFailures} and
 * {@code timeToRepair} settings. The difference to {@link DowntimeSource} is
 * that {@code timeBetweenFailures} uses the <b>beginning</b> of the last
 * maintenance as the reference, whereas {@link DowntimeSource} uses the
 * <b>end</b> of the last downtime.
 * <p>
 * A simple example: consider a machine that is going to be down every 24 hours
 * for a duration of 1 hour, i.e., it is available for processing for 23 hours.
 * Using {@code MaintenanceSource}, this is modeled setting
 * {@code timeBetweenFailures} to 24 hours and using a {@code timeToRepair} of 1
 * hour.
